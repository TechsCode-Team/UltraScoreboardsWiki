* **`Why can I only have 15 lines on my scoreboard?`**
   Due to the way Minecraft created the scoreboard system itself, the hard-coded limit for scoreboards is 15 lines with a header. Hopefully there will be an update       that allows for more customization. 
* **`Does this plugin support offline mode`**
  While it may work for some servers, our plugins are not made to work on offline/cracked servers, and general support is limited.
