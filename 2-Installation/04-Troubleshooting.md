## Troubleshooting guide
**My plugin is not connecting to MySQL.**
<br>

* If your plugin is not connecting to MySQL or is taking to long to test the connection if means that you have filled in the wrong credentials, or haven't setup your MySQL correctly on your hosting provider's end.
<br>

**Proxy isn't connected.**
<br>

* If your proxy isn't connected you need to do it manually.
  First, we need the MySQL key from a connected server. 
  This can be found in there *\SERVER_DIRECOTRY\plugins\UltraScoreboards*. 
  Here you need to copy the MySQL key.
<br>

**``NOTE:`` This key can continue on a second line, so make sure to copy it all!**
