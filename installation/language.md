# Language
Once you have installed Ultra Scoreboards you can change the language it will use, and therefore change the names of buttons, messages and more. You can decide whether to use the 12 translations we provide by default or create your own.
<br>

## Default Languages
By default the language will be English, but in addition we provide 12 different languages including (`Italian`, `French`, `Spanish`, `German`, `Dutch`, `Polish`, `Portuguese`, `Russian`, `Hungarian`, `Czech`, `Korean`, `Taiwan`), we do not guarantee that the translations are perfect, as these have been made by our community.
<br>

For select the language you want to use you will need to open the main plugin's GUI that you open by executing the command `/uboard`.
<br>

Then click on the Command Block in the bottom of the GUI. *(Called `Settings`)*
<br>

Then click on the Book and Quill in the top-right of the GUI. *(Called `Language`)*
<br>

Then click on the language that you want to use.
<br>

If you would like to edit one of our translations you can make a Pull Request on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TechsCode-Team/PluginTranslations/tree/main/Translations).
<br>

## Custom Language
If you don't want to use the translations we provide, you can create your own and customise it as you wish. To do this you will have to create 2 different files in the folder `Languages` which you will find inside the one called `UltraScoreboards`. The first file should be called `Base_MyLanguage`, you can replace `MyLanguage` with the name you prefer, the second file should be called `UltraScoreboards_MyLanguage`, here you  need to replace `MyLanguage` with the same one that you used in the first file. In the first file you will need to copy and paste the text that you find on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TechsCode-Team/PluginTranslations/blob/main/Templates/Base_English.lang), while for the second file you have to paste the text that you find **[HERE](https://github.com/TechsCode-Team/PluginTranslations/blob/main/Templates/UltraScoreboards_English.lang)**. After that you can edit as many sentences as you want, and then you will have to restart your server for your translation to load.
