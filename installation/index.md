# Server Requirements
Ultra Scoreboards requires **[Spigot](https://getbukkit.org/download/spigot)**, **[PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads)**, or **[any other fork](https://github.com/Anything-Minecraft-Team/anything-minecraft/blob/main/docs/server/info/lists/server_software.md)** of spigot to run smoothly. We recommend using **PaperMC** to ensure the best possible performance.
<br>

## Server Version
Ultra Scoreboards is supported on all versions (release) from **1.8.8 to 1.21.X**. Versions under 1.8 and every pre-release/snapshot will not receive any support.
<br>

**`NOTE:` Our plugins do not officially support offline-mode!**
<br>
While we work on updating the core of our plugins, our plugins currently do not support Velocity or any fork thereof.
