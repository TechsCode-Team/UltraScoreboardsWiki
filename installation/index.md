# Server Requirements
Ultra Scoreboards requires **[Spigot](https://getbukkit.org/download/spigot)**, **[PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads)**, or **[any other fork](https://github.com/SpiritenHasArrived/MC/blob/main/Server_Side/server_jars.md#bukkit--a-z)** of spigot to run smoothly. We recommend using **PaperMC** to ensure the best possible performance.
