# Server installation
First step is to download Ultra Scoreboards. You can find the files you need either: 
<br>
**[Here for SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ultra-scoreboards.93726/)**
<br>
**[Here for BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/resources/ultra-scoreboards.20697)**
<br>
**[Here for PolyMart](https://polymart.org/product/1401/ultra-scoreboards)**

<br>
Once you're done with this. `Stop your server`, and put the .jar file inside the `plugins` directory of your server.
<br>

Once the .jar has been uploaded in your folder, you can start your server.
<br>

Once your server has started, a new folder called Ultra Scoreboards should have been created, inside the `plugins` directory. This means that Ultra Scoreboards has loaded properly and can now be used.
<br>

## Testing the plugin
While your server is starting, look at the console for any possible [ERROR] message. Any [WARN] is not a problem, and will not disturb your use of the plugin.

<br>
You should now be able to do `/uboard` to open the GUI.
<br>
If you see a gui, that means you are good to go!
<br>
